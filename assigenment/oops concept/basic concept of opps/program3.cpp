What is the difference between OOP and POP?

OOP (Object-Oriented Programming): 

Focuses on organizing code around objects, 
which encapsulate data and behavior. 
It emphasizes concepts like classes, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction.

POP (Procedural Programming): 

Focuses on procedures or routines that perform operations on data. 
It relies on a top-down approach, breaking a program into a series of functions. 
Data and procedures are typically separated, and it doesn't emphasize concepts like classes or inheritance.
